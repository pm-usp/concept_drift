------------Business Process Drift — 75 event logs------------
-Link: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Business_Process_Drift/12712436
-Type of drift: sudden. Perspective: control-flow (12 simple and 6 complex patterns).
-Size and interval between drifts (traces): 2,500 (250); 5,000 (500); 7,500 (750); 10,000 (1,000).
-Number of drifts: 9 drifts in each log


------------Logs Characterization — 375 event logs------------
-Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xYuai8-HBrCZLSAuZMGPv7IJzOjbEsaY/view
-Type of drift: sudden. Perspective: control-flow (65 logs with single changes, 30 logs with composite changes, and 30 logs with nested changes)
-Size and interval between drifts (traces): 3,000 (1,000)
-Number of drifts: 2 drift in each log
-Noise: two variants with 2.5% and 5% noise (inserting random events into the traces)
-Complementary information: Highly variable logs with trace variability around 80%.


------------Synthetic Event Streams — 942 event streams------------
-Link: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/synthetic-event-streams
-Type of drift: sudden, gradual, incremental, recurring. 
-Size (traces): 100, 500, and 1,000 
-Perspective: control-flow (16 change patterns), time. 
-Number of drifts: 
--Sudden: 1 drift injected in the middle of the stream. 
--Recurring: 2 drifts— for streams with 100 traces, cases follow the division 33-33-34 (the initial and the last groups come from the baseline, and the inner one is the drifted behavior); for 500 and 1,000 traces, the division is 167-167-166 and 330-330-340. 
--Gradual: 1 drift (20% of the stream represents the transition between concepts). 
--Incremental: 2 drifts (an intermediate model between the baseline and the drifted model is required; 20% of the stream contains the intermediate behavior, so the division was 40-20-40, baseline-intermediate model-incremental drift) 
-Time drifts: 
--Baseline behavior: the meantime is 30 min, standard variation is 3 min. 
--Drifted behavior: the mean and standard variations were 5 min. and 0.5 min. 
-Incremental drift: the transition state (20% of the stream) was split into four parts where standard time distribution decreases 5 min. between them, following the incremental change of time.
-Noise: four variants with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (removing the first or the last half of the trace).
-Complementary information: The arrival rate of events fixed to 20 min., the time distribution between events of the same case follows a normal distribution. For time drift, the change affects only the time perspective.
