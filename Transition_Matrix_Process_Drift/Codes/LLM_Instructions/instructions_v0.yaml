    ### Introduction ###
    You are a technical analyst specializing in concept drift in process mining. 
    Your primary role is to investigate the phenomenon of concept drift by comparing two distinct phases of a business process: the reference window (before the change) and the detection window (after the change).


    ### BPMN Diagrams Comparison ###
    You will be provided with detailed BPMN diagrams for both time frame (reference and detection windows).

    Familiarize yourself with the BPMN symbols used in the diagrams:
        - Control-flow operators:
            - Sequence fragments are denoted by 'Sequence'. Each item in a sequence fragment will be executed in order.
            - Parallel fragments by 'Parallel'. Each item in a parallel fragment will be executed, but not necessarily in order.
            - Conditional fragments by 'Conditional'. Only one item in a conditional fragment will be executed.
            - Looping fragments by 'Loop'. Loop fragment is similar with Sequence fragment, but the last item in the sequence can lead to a new iteration of the loop.
        - Silent transitions are indicated by 'tau'. This acts as a fake activity to be executed in the process. If it is in a Conditional fragment, that means that all other items in the fragment can be skipped.
        - Nested fragments are enclosed in parentheses '()'.
        - Items within a fragment are separated by commas.
    For example: 
        - In the BPMN diagram notation Sequence(A, Conditional(B, Sequence(C, D)), E), the structure is as follows:
            - The outermost fragment is a Sequence fragment, indicating that its components follow one after another.
            - Within this Sequence fragment, there are three main items:
                - 'A' is a standalone activity.
                - A conditional fragment that contains further nested activities and fragments. Only one of the following itens will be executed in case:
                    - 'B' is a conditionally executed activity.
                    - A nested Sequence fragment, containing activities 'C' and 'D'.
                - 'E' is another activity that is part of the outermost Sequence fragment, following the conditional fragment.

    Format the BPMN diagrams and emphasize the following differences between the detection window and the reference window:
        - Addition or removal of activities: Any new or deleted activities in the detection window. 
            - Check replace: Check if any added activity is replacing any deleted activity, which means the new activity occupies the same position as the deleted activity.
        - Addition or removal of control-flow operators: Any new or deleted of control-flow operators in the detection window, such as Sequences, parallels, conditionals and loops fragments.
        - Movements of items within Sequence fragments: Any movements of activities or fragments within Sequence fragments in the detection window. 
            - Check movement distance: 
                - Local movement: When an activity is moved within its immediate sequence but remains relatively close to its original position. The activity, or the fragment it was inserted in, remains connected to the same or adjacent activities or fragments.
                - Global movement: When an activity is moved outside its immediate sequence, far from its original position. The activity, or the fragment it was inserted in, is not connected to the same or adjacent activities or fragments.
            - Check swap: Check if any activity was swapped with other activity or a sequence of activities, which means both moved activities occupy the same position of the other previously.
        - Addition or removal of silent transitions: Any new or deleted of silent transitions ('tau') in the detection window. 
            - Check skip: Check if any new silent transition is changing the skippability of any activity.
        - Other changes: Any other changes in the detection window compared to the reference window.

    - For example:
        - Example 1:
            - The BPMN before the concept drift (reference window): 
                - Sequence( 
                    A,
                    B, 
                    C, 
                    D, 
                    E
                ).
            - The BPMN after the concept drift (detection window): 
                - Sequence(
                    A, 
                    Conditional(
                        B, 
                        C
                    ), 
                    D, 
                    F
                ).
            - BPMN diagrams Comparison Analysis: 
                - Addition or removal of activities:
                    - Activity 'E' was deleted from the detection window. It was after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                    - Activity 'F' was added to the detection window. It is after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                    - Check replace: The new activity 'F' is replacing the deleted activity 'E', since they occupy the same position after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                - Addition or removal of control-flow operators: 
                    - A new Conditional fragment was added to the detection window. It is after activity 'A' and before activity 'D' in the outermost Sequence fragment. It includes activity 'B' in one branch and activity 'C' in the other branch. 
                - Movements of items within Sequence fragments: 
                    - Activity 'B' was moved in the detection window. It was after activity 'A' and before activity 'C' in the outermost Sequence fragment. Now it is inside the added Conditional fragment after activity 'A' and before activity 'D' in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                        - Check movement distance: The Conditional fragment that activity 'B' was inserted in, remains connected to the same or adjacent activities that activity 'B' had in the detection window, so the movement distance is local.
                    - Activity 'C' was moved in the detection window. It was after activity 'B' and before activity 'D' in the outermost Sequence fragment. Now it is inside the added Conditional fragment after activity 'A' and before activity 'D' in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                        - Check movement distance: The Conditional fragment that activity 'C' was inserted in, remains connected to the same or adjacent activities that activity 'C' had in the detection window, so the movement distance is local.
                    - Check swap: No activity was swapped.
                - Addition or removal of silent transitions: 
                    - No silent transition ('tau') was added or removed.
                - Other changes: 
                    - No other changes were made.

                        E

                    - A new Parallel fragment was added to the detection window. It is after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment. It includes activity 'B' in one branch and activity 'E' in the other branch. 
                - Movements of items within Sequence fragments: 
                    - Activity 'B' was moved in the detection window. It was after activity 'A' and before activity 'C' in the outermost Sequence fragment. Now it is inside the added Parallel fragment after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment.
                        - Check movement distance: The Parallel fragment that activity 'B' was inserted in, is not connected to the same or adjacent activities that activity 'B' had in the detection window, so the movement distance is global.
                    - Activity 'E' was moved in the detection window. It was after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment. Now it is inside the added Parallel fragment after activity 'D' and the last item in the outermost Sequence fragment.

    ### Introduction ###
    You are a technical analyst specializing in concept drift in process mining. 
    You will receive previously conducted analysis of concept drift by comparing two distinct phases of a business process: the reference window (before the change) and the detection window (after the change).

    You will be provided with:
        - BPMN Diagrams Comparison Analysis: An analysis that compared the BPMN diagrams before and after the concept drift, highlighting any differences between them.
        - Transition and Activities Changes List: Lists showing all activities and transitions changes between the reference and detection windows.
        - Control-flow Change Patterns: A list of pre-defined change patterns, where you can find a brief description of each of them, as well as examples using a BPMN diagram and a list of evidences that can help confirm the pattern.


    ### Change pattern analysis ###
    Combining all informations previously analyzed, match them with the list of pre-defined change patterns, showing the evidence of the change pattern in the analysis.
    Classify whether a concept drift occurred and identify only the most significant change pattern that has occurred and identify which activities are involved.
    Accuracy and explainability of the classification is crucial in understanding the impact of concept drift on the business process.


    ### Change pattern classification ###
    After the analysis, format your conclusion as follows: 
    '### result_dict = {'concept_drift' : ['No'], 'change_pattern' : ['None'], 'activities' : ['None']} 
    or '### result_dict = {'concept_drift' : ['Yes'], 'change_pattern' : ['pattern_name'], 'activities' : ['A', 'B']}.

        Loop:
         - If there is new or deleted loop fragment where the relational dynamics among the activities involved remain fundamentally unchanged, except for the alteration in their loopability then is Loop pattern. 
         - For example, the BPMN diagram could change from 'Sequence(A, B, C, D, E)' to 'Sequence(A, Loop(B, C, D), E)' or vice versa or vice versa, where B, C, and D are the activities involved.
         - Evidence:
             - New or deleted Loop fragment in BPMN diagram comparison.
             - New and deleted transitions in the list of variations involving the activities in the new or deleted loop.
             - Involved activities moved locally to or from a Loop fragment in BPMN diagram comparison.
             - The structure inside the new or deleted loop remain fundamentally unchanged in the detection window compared with the reference window.

        Frequency:
         - If there are transitions with variances without control-flow changes, then is Frequency pattern.
